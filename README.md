# Lem and Lime Studios

# Design Document

## Who are we:

We are Lem and Lime Studios. Our members are:

- Jonathan Bertram (u18138358)
- Jaedon Heger (u18058737).

Together we bring innovative and creative ideas to life.

## Goal of the website:

We aim to showcase some of the best work created by Lem and Lime studios across a
number of disciplines to show the diversity of our skills and abilities. We hope to deliver this
in an interesting and interactive way.

## Our vision for the website:

## Landing page sections and concepts :

#### Landing Page:

```
The landing page of the website will be dominated by a large jellyfish that we will
model in 3D with a high level of detail. This jellyfish will be a recurring theme
throughout the website. Because of this, the idea of water and the ocean will also be
incorporated into elements of the site such as certain interactions and feedback
methods discussed below. This idea was inspired by (​ TERU Inc. ​ ,2020) The jellyfish
will move as if thit is suspended in a body of water, with its tentacles waving gently. It will
also glow a bright colour which will stand out significantly against the desaturated
background of the page. The home page will consist of this 3D model, a burger menu
option, a series of dots and lines illustrating the number of pages in the site and
indicating the possibility of scrolling which is also shown by the “More” tag with a down
arrow in the bottom left hand corner. The jellyfish will spin slowly around the words “lem
a” and “lime” that serve as a background to the site and are partly obstructed by the
jellyfish for artistic effect. The logo and full name of the company is shown in a small font
in the top right hand corner for formality’s sake. We taim for this page to achieve a
simplistic look and for the intricacy and detail of the jellyfish model to be the main point of
attention for the user as they enter the site.
```

#### Portfolio:

This will be the section which will contain links to separate pages where we will
showcase our work and content that we have created. Each project will be displayed
in its own block that will show the user more information about the project on certain
actions. For example, if untouched, the block will display some sort of image relating
to the project along with its name. Upon hovering the mouse over the block, the user
will be able to see more information about the project through an animated gif and a
further description about the project. Clicking on the block will take the user to a

##### separate page dedicated to showing off that project by itself ​ (Digital Panda, ​ 2020).

The user will be able to cycle through the blocks of content by scrolling.


#### About Us:

This page will give the user a brief understanding of the members of the studio and
their personal hobbies and interests. This is added to make the user feel like they are
interacting with real people if they choose to contact the studio for work inquiries. We
want to ensure that the studio feels grounded. The content of this page will include
an image or avatar representing each member of the studio, their names, and a brief
description about them. It will also include quick links to contact any of the members
directly by email, for example.

#### Footer:

An extensive footer will be added to the bottom of the page. It will be used to display
extra links and information that we do not want to clutter other parts of the page with.
This will include links to social media sites and links that lead directly back to different
parts of the portfolio,making it easy for users to navigate back to a section they might
want to dive deeper into following a first look of the page. The footer will also be
styled as to match the look of a sea bed. 3D modelled rocks and seaweed will line
the bottom of the page and it too will animate slightly, like the jellyfish.


### Other Pages/Portfolio Content:

These pages will be used to showcase and focus on our projects in more depth. The
background for these will still contain the jellyfish.

#### Hex Game:

```
This will be showcased with a series of recordings and images of gameplay. The
process of design will also be described , from showcasing our paper prototype to
our most current version of the game. Tutorial in webgl form to allow them to
experience the game.
```
#### Horror short film:

```
The trailer will be featured on this page. A short description of this will be included
along with the link to the entire horror film.
```
#### 3d models:

```
Some of our past 3d models will be showcased on this website. This will be a link to
a page where there will be orbit controls to allow the user to move around the 3d
model and manipulate the 3d camera to view the 3d model from different views.
```
#### Website design:

```
For website design we will showcase a website created for adventure travels. This
website allows users to book holidays, post their own locations, add friends and
message people. This will be showcased by including different images of the website
describing the design stages and will incorporate a link to the website as well.
```
#### Typography animated videos:

```
This will be in the form of videos which will showcase our animations of typography
for the use in music videos.
```
#### UI/UX Design for a recipe app fud:

```
Screenshots of design along with the process used to create this will be discussed.
We will also include Details of how often user tests were conducted and the manner
in which they were done in order to show our dedication to user centered and
iterative design process.
```

### Navigation:

For navigation we have decided to go for a minimalistic approach. On the left hand side we
will include a series of dots and lines indicating the user’s current position on the landing
page. This will allow users to quickly view where they are in the website and decide where
they would like to go.

To accommodate for different expectations of navigation we have also decided to include a
burger menu at the top right hand side. This will contain text descriptions of the pages which
the user can navigate between.
Links Included in this menu:
● Home
● Our work
● About us

The user can also move between the pages through scrolling. We have included these
multiple ways of interaction to try and accommodate for all ways in which a user may want to
navigate through the website and avoid frustration caused by confusion as much as
possible.

The final navigation area we will have will be the footer. It will be an ocean bottom to keep in
with the theme and provide variation. In this area will be quick links back up to the different
pages along with some direct links to our work to allow the user to quickly reach where they
need to if they have reached the bottom of the page.

### Color scheme:

For each page we will use a distinctive color to accent the dark background to make it
immediately apparent to the user where they are at all times. These will also be conveyed
through the navigation circles on the left hand side where each circle will be the color of the
page to aid in recognition. When deciding on colors for these we will carefully choose colors
with enough contrast to allow users who may be color blind to still be able to interact with the
website and see all of its content.

The overall aim of glowing colors on a dark background is to give a futuristic and innovative
feel to the website. A similar feel will be given as from ​ _NCSOFT_ ​ (2020) where they utilise
glowing elements on a darker background. Each section having its own color is used to portray
different meanings through the glow to the user according to color psychology.

Below is an example color palette for the gold landing section of the page. The hue of the colors
will vary per page as described below.


For the first thing a user will see on the landing section, we have decided to go with a gold glow
of the jellyfish to portray luxury and quality of our brand as a whole (​The Color Gold ,2020)​.
Similarly jellyfish are exotic and elegant creatures and we feel that this reflects the companies
design intents accurately. These combined with the use of technologies show the user our
sophisticated and expansive knowledge in content creation.

For the works section of the page we decided to go with a blue glowing jellyfish. This is due to
blue portraying the feeling of trust to users (Packaging Colors,2020)​.​ It will also be less
distracting addition to the background where the main focus will be drawn to the blocks and the
works they are showcasing.

For the about us section we will use purple. Purple is often used to convey wisdom and
royalty(​Effects of the Color Purple on Mood and Behavior ,2020​). We think this will be
beneficial to portray to users our knowledge in the area of content creation.

The footer section of the page will take the 3 colors used above and combine them to keep
consistency with the pages above while also emphasising the importance of what each color
portrays.

### Interactions:

The jellyfish and underwater theme of the website will be further conveyed through the way
users will be interacting with the website.

#### Cursor

```
The first thing to mention will be the cursor which will be replaced by a bubble. This
bubble will be a svg with a flowing animation. On hover over an interactable element
such as the burger menu navigation the bubble will change size and color to match
the current glow color of the jellyfish. Indicating that the element is interactable. The
idea we are going for this is inspired by ​ 14islands.com ​(2020). And we aim for a similar
feel as when the user hovers over the content for the cursor
```

#### Scrolling

```
We will remove the ability to scroll down to any point in the page and replace it with a
sticky scroll or a scroll where upon scrolling down it jumps to the new page with its
information. A similar idea is implemented on the website ​ Reputation Defender
Singapore ​(2020) where users scrolling moves the page onto a specific position. ​We are
doing this as we can fine tune our transitions of the pages and allow content to
appear in interesting ways without breaking the flow of the webpage.
```
```
The aim of having all information areas contained in one page that has limited
scrolling from one page to the next is to give a feeling of flow to the website. This
accentuates the underwater theme while making navigation through the site feel
simple and intuitive. The changing of pages will be accompanied by a transition of
the camera angle,inspired by the website ​ Mausoleum of Augustus ​ (2020). This will be
accompanied by ​movement of the jellyfish along with its glowing color changing to
match the theme of the page.
```
#### Mouse Movement:

```
Since we are using 3d technologies we want to play into the strengths of the medium.
Hence when the user moves their mouse it will add a very small rotation to the
jellyfish. This can also be seen in the website ​Warner, J. (2020) where the header has
slight movement according to the movement of the mouse.
```
## Animations

#### Background:

```
For the jellyfish in the background we will use a simple animation of the tentacles
floating gently in water. This brings life to the website while allowing us to draw the
user's attention to the foreground as opposed to the background drawing all of the
attention from the user.
```
```
When a user changes pages a more in depth animation will be played. This will not
take much of the users time but aims to keep the interest of the user as they change
pages. This will be in the form of the jellyfish changing color and the changing of
camera angles and possibly the jellyfish moving in a new and interesting way. The
movement and changing of the background revolving around one 3d model is
inspired by ​ Mav Farm ​ (2020).
```
#### Cursor:

```
The cursor will also be changed to add to the underwater theme of the website. This
will be an animated svg instead of the default pointer. This will have a gentle
```

```
animation as well as to not distract the user but rather add to the experience.
Similarly this will allow us to change the color of the cursor to glow when something
is interactable such as the burger menu or links to the individual pages to showcase
our content.
```
## Technologies used to create the website:

##### ● Blender for 3d modelling and animation
